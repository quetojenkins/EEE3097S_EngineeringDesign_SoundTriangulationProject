# EEE3097S_EngineeringDesign_SoundTriangulationProject

## Description

The Acoustic Triangulation System project aims to design and implement a robust acoustic triangulation system using Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) to accurately locate the position of a sound source within an A1 rectangular grid. This system is designed to provide a reliable solution for tracking sound sources and can be used in various applications, such as surveillance, wildlife monitoring, and security.

### Motivation

Our motivation for this project is to create an accessible and cost-effective solution for sound source localization. Many existing systems are expensive and complex, making them inaccessible for smaller projects or individuals interested in experimenting with sound localization techniques. We aim to provide a practical and educational tool for both enthusiasts and professionals.

### Problem Statement

The project addresses the challenge of accurately determining the position of a sound source within a grid, even when it is in motion. This requires precise audio signal capture, TDoA calculations, and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visualization.

### Key Objectives

- Design and implement an A1 rectangular grid.
- Integrate four microphone breakout boards for audio signal capture.
- Utilize two Raspberry Pi microcontrollers for data processing.
- Calculate the two-dimensional coordinates of the sound source using TDoA.
- Develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for displaying localization results.
- Optionally, implement tracking of a moving sound source.

### Learning Goals

Throughout this project, we aim to learn and apply the following:

- Acoustic signal processing techniques.
- Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) algorithms.
- Raspberry Pi programming and interfacing with sensors.
- GUI development.
- Project management and collaboration skills.
